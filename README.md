### I'm Dave Ross and I love to build things.
#### Things that everybody can use. Things that empower. Things that are fun.

I'm an engineering leader, a certified accessibility professional, a runner, a feral cat socializer, and I love fixing and using vintage Commodore and Apple computers.

My pronouns are [he/him/his](http://pronoun.is/he/him/his)

Skills: JavaScript/NodeJS : Go : PHP : HTML/CSS

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on [Adrian](https://github.com/daveross/adrian), a web server for fonts. Kind of like your own personal Google Fonts.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning The React ecosystem. I'm also going back and learning Go properly instead of picking up parts as I need them.

ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on Software that makes hosting your own stuff less daunting for regular folks

âš¡ Fun fact: I volunteer with shy, feral, and abused cats to help them learn trust and go on to find the loving homes they deserve!
