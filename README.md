This is a stock photo of a desk. It's a really nice desk, don't get me wrong. It's so tidy.

My desk looks nothing like this. They say the state of someone's desk reflects their state of mind. My desk reflects a mind and body in motion. It's where I *work* and it's where I *work out*. It's not messy, but it's crowded. It's where I take on many of my work and personal projects.
