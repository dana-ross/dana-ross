This is a stock photo of a desk. It's a really nice desk, don't get me wrong. It's so tidy.

My desk looks nothing like this. They say the state of someone's desk reflects their state of mind. My desk reflects a mind and body in motion. It's where I *work* and it's where I *work out*. It's not messy, but it's crowded. It's where I take on many of my work and personal projects.

### About me
I'm an engineering leader, a certified accessibility professional, a runner, a feral cat socializer, and I love fixing and using vintage Commodore and Apple computers.

My pronouns are [she/her](http://pronoun.is/they/she/her)

Skills: JavaScript/NodeJS : Go : PHP : HTML/CSS

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on [Adrian](https://github.com/daveross/adrian), a web server for fonts. Kind of like your own personal Google Fonts.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning more about the React ecosystem. I'm also going back and learning Go properly instead of picking up parts as I need them.

ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on software that makes it less daunting for regular folks to host their own applications.

âš¡ Fun fact: I volunteer with shy, feral, and abused cats to help them learn trust and go on to find the loving homes they deserve!
